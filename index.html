The names and identities of these five elements vary between astrological interpretation under different zodiacs.  Most commonly, they include <i>earth</i>, <i>fire</i> and <i>water</i>.  In Japanese philosophy, the other two elements are <i>wind</i> and <i>void</i>.  In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xing">Wu Xing</a>, they are <i>metal</i> and <i>wood</i>.  In Western astrology, there is simply a fourth element:  <i>Air</i> or wind (which corresponds to Libra, Aquarius and Gemini).  In Chinese astrology, <i>earth</i> is the element which is not appointed any of the four compass directions and is said to represent balance, while in Japanese philosophy it is seen as the weakest of the elements.
